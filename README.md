### Google Workspace Integration Steps 

Clone the server-configuration folder, (which is a nested git repo)
Within the server configuration file, clone the google-server folder

In the server-configuration/deployment-management.js file, enter your Glitch server name
In the server-configuration/package.json file, enter your GAS script ID. 
- Create a Google Sheet/Apps Script project
- Find the script id in the settings
- Create a Google Cloud Project
  - Create an Oauth Screen with your account as a "test" account for the OAuth screen
  - Enable APIs - AppsScript, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Gmail
  - Locate your project number in the Google Cloud
    - Add the project number to the GAS project (on the settings page)

Push to GAS with `run run push` (from the server-configuration folder). Changes can be view in GAS editor located in the spreadsheet menu
(Extensions < Apps Script)

- If this is the first time deploying this, you must do this through the GAS Editor
  - Deploy < New Deployment < Web App < Apply Permissions < Deploy


Your Glitch app should be deployed within a Google Iframe, and now able to communicate with Google via an IFrame "API"
