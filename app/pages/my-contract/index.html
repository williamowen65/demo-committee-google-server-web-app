          This contract, along with all required images and electronic payment, are due on or before March 2, 2025.

          <u><strong style="text-wrap: nowrap;">I hereby agree:</strong></u>

          - My studio is either within the boundaries of the GHOST tour map OR I will be sharing studio space
          with another artist

          - To open my studio display during the hours of 10AM to 5PM on September 19, 20 and 21, 2025, and be
          present during those hours.

          - To have current, original, one-of-a-kind artwork prominently displayed at GHOST.

          - To abide by restrictions on commercial reproductions: less prominent placement, clear and accurate
          labeling as a reproduction. Any item sold at GHOST must be from artist's own images.

          - To show visitors my workspace and demonstrate my techniques on works-in-progress. I will make my
          process visible in a way that will enable visitors to learn more about my art form. Hosted artists
          must comply with all the above except workspace.

          - To serve as an active participant on one of the designated committees that help to produce the Tour.
          All artists, even those that live outside of the tour boundaries, are expected to sign up for a
          volunteer position on one of our committees.

          - Attend all general meetings held to disseminate information and organize a smooth-running tour.

          - I understand that: If another artist hosts me, he/she must be a qualified GHOST participant and I
          cannot invite non-member artists to show work in my studio.

          - Alcoholic beverages will not be offered if refreshments are provided at my studio.

          - Artists who need insurance coverage for their artwork need to look into a homeowner's or business
          insurance policy.

          - Participant agrees to hold harmless Gig Harbor Open Studio Tour, Studio Tour Board, participating
          artists, and participating studio owners from all claims, demands, actions and causes of action for
          any and all injuries or damage to or theft of artwork displayed and any personal property brought to
          the Tour. The artist assumes all risk of loss or damage to the artist's property.

          - If the tour needs to be canceled due to unforeseeable circumstances, the refund amount will depend
          on the bills & payments already made for tour requirements.

          - If I cancel from the tour for any reason after the last day to approve changes to our brochure,
          there is no refund.

          - If I fail to comply with the Gig Harbor Open Studio Tour Guidelines and the conditions listed
          herein, including not fulfilling my committee responsibilities, I will be ineligible for subsequent
          GHOST Events.

          <u><strong> I agree to participate in the following GHOST Timeline:</strong></u>

          ### <b>Sharing studios:</b>

          <p>Please note that we would like to encourage artists to share studio space where possible since these
            studios
            will get the most visitors! Our goal is to have at least 2 artists per studio – more, if possible. Shared
            studio space could include garages and indoor spaces.</p>

              from home. If special skills are required for that position, it will be indicated in the description.

              Check the box by the specific volunteer job you are willing to be responsible for, as long as that
              position shows that at least one more person is needed. You can participate in more than one position, if
              desired (many of us do and we appreciate that!!)

              If the specific position involves specific skills, make sure you already have those skills or at least a
              comfort level and willingness to learn those skills before signing up for that position so that you don't
              let down your committee!

              Please note that failure to fulfill your committee responsibility will make you ineligible to participate
              in future Open Studio Tours.
